# chibicc: A Small C Compiler

(The old master has moved to
[historical/old](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc/tree/historical/old)
branch. This is a new one uploaded in September 2020.)

chibicc is yet another small C compiler that implements most C11
features. Even though it still probably falls into the "toy compilers"
category just like other small compilers do, chibicc can compile several
real-world programs, including [Git](https://git-scm.com/),
[SQLite](https://sqlite.org) and
[libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html), without making
modifications to the compiled programs.  Generated executables of these
programs pass their corresponding test suites. So, chibicc actually
supports a wide variety of C11 features and is able to compile hundreds of
thousands of lines of real-world C code correctly.

chibicc is developed as the reference implementation for a book I'm
currently writing about the C compiler and the low-level programming.
The book covers the vast topic with an incremental approach; in the first
chapter, readers will implement a "compiler" that accepts just a single
number as a "language", which will then gain one feature at a time in each
section of the book until the language that the compiler accepts matches
what the C11 spec specifies. I took this incremental approach from [the
paper](http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf) by Abdulaziz
Ghuloum.

Each commit of this project corresponds to a section of the book. For this
purpose, not only the final state of the project but each commit was
carefully written with readability in mind. Readers should be able to learn
how a C language feature can be implemented just by reading one or a few
commits of this project. For example, this is how
[while](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc/commit/773115ab2a9c4b96f804311b95b20e9771f0190a),

and [thread-local
variable](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc/commit/79644e54cc1805e54428cde68b20d6d493b76d34)
are implemented. If you have plenty of spare time, it might be fun to read
it from the [first
commit](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc/commit/0522e2d77e3ab82d3b80a5be8dbbdc8d4180561c).

If you like this project, please consider purchasing a copy of the book
when it becomes available! ðŸ˜€ I publish the source code here to give people
early access to it, because I was planing to do that anyway with a
permissive open-source license after publishing the book. If I don't charge
for the source code, it doesn't make much sense to me to keep it private. I
hope to publish the book in 2021.

I pronounce chibicc as _chee bee cee cee_. "chibi" means "mini" or
"small" in Japanese. "cc" stands for C compiler.

## Status

Features that are often missing in a small compiler but supported by
chibicc include (but not limited to):

- Preprocessor
- long double (x87 80-bit floating point numbers)
- Bit-field
- alloca()
- Variable-length array
- Thread-local variable
- Atomic variable
- Common symbol
- Designated initializer
- L, u, U and u8 string literals

chibicc does not support digraphs, trigraphs, complex numbers, K&R-style
function prototype, and inline assembly.

chibicc outputs a simple but nice error message when it finds an error in
source code.

There's no optimization pass. chibicc emits terrible code which is probably
twice or more slower than GCC's output. I have a plan to add an
optimization pass once the frontend is done.

## Internals

chibicc consists of the following stages:

- Tokenize: A tokenizer takes a string as an input, breaks it into a list
  of tokens and returns them.

- Preprocess: A preprocessor takes as an input a list of tokens and output
  a new list of macro-expanded tokens. It interprets preprocessor
  directives while expanding macros.

- Parse: A recursive descendent parser constructs abstract syntax trees
  from the output of the preprocessor. It also adds a type to each AST
  node.

- Codegen: A code generator emits an assembly text for given AST nodes.

## Contributing

When I find a bug in this compiler, I go back to the original commit that
introduced the bug and rewrite the commit history as if there were no such
bug from the beginning. This is an unusual way of fixing bugs, but as a a
part of a book, it is important to keep every commit bug-free.

Thus, I do not take pull requests in this repo. You can send me a pull
request if you find a bug, but it is very likely that I will read your
patch and then apply that to my previous commits by rewriting history. I'll
credit your name somewhere, but your changes will be rewritten by me before
submitted to this repository.

Also, please assume that I will occasionally force-push my local repository
to this public one to rewrite history. If you clone this project and make
local commits on top of it, your changes will have to be rebased by hand
when I force-push new commits.

I'm Rui Ueyama. I'm the creator of [8cc](https://github.com/rui314/8cc),
which is a hobby C compiler, and also the original creator of the current
version of [LLVM lld](https://lld.llvm.org) linker, which is a
production-quality linker used by various operating systems and large-scale
build systems.

  Bellard. I learned a lot from this compiler, but the design of tcc and
  chibicc are different. In particular, tcc is a one-pass compiler, while
  chibicc is a multi-pass one.
